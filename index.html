                <h2 id="history">History</h2>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Fixed gear bikes have been around since the early days of cycling, originally emerging in the late 19th century. They were the standard type of bicycle before freewheel mechanisms were invented. This means that whenever the wheels turned, the pedals turned too.

                Initially popularized in track cycling events due to their simplicity and efficiency, fixed gear bikes later found favor among urban cyclists and bicycle messengers for their low maintenance and maneuverability in city environments.
                
                In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, fixed gear bikes experienced a resurgence in popularity, becoming a subculture favorite for their minimalist style and customization options. They remain a staple in urban cycling communities today, loved for their direct connection to the road and the sense of freedom they provide.</p>
